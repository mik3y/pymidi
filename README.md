# pymidi

A python RTP-MIDI / AppleMIDI implementation. You can use this library to build a network attached virtual MIDI device.

## Quickstart

```
$ pip install pymidi
```
or

```
poetry install pymidi
```

See [Using in Another Project](#using-in-another-project) and the [Developer Setup wiki](wiki/Developer-MIDI-Setup) for more information.

## Developer Setup

Set up your workspace with the very excellent [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```
$ poetry install
```

Once installed, you'll probably find it useful to work in a `poetry shell`, for ease of testing and running things:

```
$ poetry shell
(pymidi-tFFCbXNj)
$ python pymidi/server.py
```

### Compatibility

`pymidi` requires Python 3. It has been tested against Python 3.6 and Python 3.7.

### Running tests

Tests are run with pytest:

```
$ pytest
```

### Developing against something else

If you're working on a project that uses `pymidi` and want to develop both concurrently, leverage the setuptools `develop` command:

```
$ cd ~/git/otherproject
$ poetry shell
$ pushd ~/git/pymidi && python setup.py develop && popd
```

This creates a link to `~/git/pymidi` within the environment of `~/git/otherproject`.

## Demo Server and Examples

The library includes a simple demo server which prints stuff.

```
$ python pymidi/examples/example_server.py
```

See `--help` for usage. See the `examples/` directory for other examples.

## Using in Another Project

Most likely you will want to embed a server in another project, and respond to MIDI commands in some application specific way. The demo serve is an example of what you need to do.

First, create a subclass of `server.Handler` to implement your policy:

```py
from pymidi import server

class MyHandler(server.Handler):
    def on_peer_connected(self, peer):
        print('Peer connected: {}'.format(peer))

    def on_peer_disconnected(self, peer):
        print('Peer disconnected: {}'.format(peer))

    def on_midi_commands(self, peer, midi_packet):
        for command in midi_packet.command.midi_list:
            if command.command == 'note_on':
                key = command.params.key
                velocity = command.params.velocity
                print('Someone hit the key {} with velocity {}'.format(key, velocity))
```

Then install it in a server and start serving:

```
myServer = server.Server([('0.0.0.0', 5051)])
myServer.add_handler(MyHandler())
myServer.serve_forever()
```

See the [Developer Setup wiki](https://github.com/mik3y/pymidi/wiki/Developer-MIDI-Setup) for ways to test with real devices.

## Project Status

What works:
* Exchange packet parsing
* Timestamp sync packet parsing
* Exchange & timestamp sync protocol support
* MIDI message parsing

Not (yet) implemented:
* Journal contents parsing
* Verification of peers on the data channel
* Auto-disconnect peers that stop synchronizing clocks
